Okay, here?s the categorized and sorted list of your grocery items:

**1. Produce**

2. Broccoli
3. Dark Chocolate (While technically a treat, it?s often grouped with produce due to its origins)
4. Red Onions
5. Tomatoes

**2. Bakery**

**Note:** *Some items could arguably fit into multiple categories (e.g., Dark Chocolate could be considered a snack or a treat). I?ve placed them in what I believe is the most common categorization.* 

Do you want me to adjust any of the categories or sorting based on a specific preference?
